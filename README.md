# Smart Park - mobile android application

ðŸ“š "Mobile Development" project (Artificial Intelligence, UniGe)

The Smart Park application has the purpose to store the current gps location when parking the car. 
It can do it in 3 different ways:
- Manually:
  - Saves the current gps location clicking a button in the home.
- Automatic: (If the car restart repeat the procedure from the beginning)
  - With Bluetooth:
    - Saves in a temporary variable the current gps location every times that the car stops.
    - Checks the bluetoothâ€™s name and if itâ€™s still connected to the car.
    - If itâ€™s unconnected it saves permanently the temporary position (If you get too far from the car the bluetooth will automatically unlink).
  - Without Bluetooth:
    - Saves in a temporary variable the current gps location every times that the car stops.
    - Using the accelerometer of the smartphone it checks if the speed of the car is under a certain value (for example walking) for a certain amount of time (for example 5 
  minutes).
    - The app also checks that the count of steps is higher than a certain limit (for example 15 steps, it means that the user gets away from the car).
    - Saves the temporary position permanently.

Other features:
- In the homepage is displayed the gps position through the coordinates and a map.
- The user can add informations to the gps position like a picture and some notes.
- The user can clear the saved gps position and the correlated informations.
